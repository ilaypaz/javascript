    <h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
    <p>
        Hello there!
        My name is Ilay Paz and I am a 4th year Bioinformatics student here at Langara College.
        I am taking this course because Javascript is applicable to a 4th year course Data Visualization and I think
        Javascript is a good hard skill to know as a Bioinformatician. I know C++, Java and am learning alongside
        Javascript this semester SQL and Python which are both very useful languages. In the future I want to learn how
        to use Ruby, C# and Kotlin. I am currently searching for a coop so if you, whomever is reading this has a COOP
        in software engineering, data analysis, biology or bioinformatics please email me at ipaz00@mylangara.ca. I
        can't think of another thing to write so here is my last sentence.
    </p>
